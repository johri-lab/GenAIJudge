# GenAIJudge

Our approach involves using ChaptGPT to intelligently: 
1. Summarize the problem and solution
2. ⁠Comment and provide rating for different rubrics 
3. ⁠Summarize the proposal 
4. ⁠(Future) Highlight key sentences in proposal 

**AIEarthHack.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook to preprocess the dataset.

**Harvard Hack Proposals Visualization.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook to visualize proposals embedded using Sentence Transformer. After cleaning, the summaries are embedded and visualized in 3D. Human judges can interactively select the proposals of interest and disregard clusters of uninteresting proposals.

**dataset.csv**: Cleaned dataset of summaries.
