# GenAIJudge

Our approach involves using ChaptGPT to intelligently: 
1. summarize the problem and solution
2. ⁠comment and provide rating for different rubrics 
3. ⁠summarize the proposal 
4. ⁠(Future) Highlight key sentences in proposal 

After cleaning, the summaries are embedded and visualized in 3D. Human judges can interactively select the proposals of interest and disregard clusters of uninteresting proposals
